Consider  and  to be two points on a 2D plane where  are the respective minimum and maximum values of 
Northern Latitude (LAT_N) and  are the respective minimum and maximum values of Western Longitude (LONG_W) in STATION.

Query the Euclidean Distance between points  and  and format your answer to display  decimal digits.

Solution:

Select round(sqrt(power((Min(LAT_N) - Max(lat_n)),2) + power((Min(Long_w) - Max(long_w)),2)),4) from STATION; //mysql based solution
